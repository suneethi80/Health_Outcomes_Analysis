R Shiny Web App: https://suneethi.shinyapps.io/Health_Counties_withtitlecopy/

Goal: The goal of this analysis is to identify any differences in health measures between rural and urban counties. The app shows the health measures and mortality rate in each of the counties in Tennessee.

The analysis focussed on identifying the percentage of population who are smokers, obese, diabetics and affected by excessive drinking. It also looked at mortality rates and the mortality data included infant mortality rate and child mortality rate and deaths due to motor vehicle, homicide, firearm, drug overdose, alcohol impairment.
Data: Health measures data was from the county health rankings dataset which is a collaborative program between University of Wisconsin and Robert Woods Johnson Foundation.

Conclusion: There does not seem to be major differences between the top 6 rural and urban counties in Tennessee.
